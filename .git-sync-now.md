# Immediate Sync Steps

## Current Situation
- Your branch is behind `origin/main` by 10 commits
- You have local changes in several files
- `pyproject.toml` is now configured to stay machine-specific

## Steps to Sync Now

### 1. Commit Your Current Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Training server: add slurm scripts and update README"
```

### 2. Pull from Origin (Your Fork)
```bash
git pull origin main
```
Note: `pyproject.toml` will automatically keep your local version thanks to the `merge=ours` strategy!

### 3. Check Everything is OK
```bash
git status
git log --oneline -5
```

### 4. Push Everything Back
```bash
git push origin main
```

Done! Your training server is now synced with your remote fork.

## On Your Inference Server (Later)

When you're on your other machine, just run:
```bash
# Make sure you have the same .gitattributes setup
git config merge.ours.driver true

# Commit any local changes
git add .
git commit -m "Inference server updates"

# Pull updates (your pyproject.toml stays intact)
git pull origin main
```

## Future Workflow

From now on, it's super simple:

**Daily work:**
```bash
# Make changes
# ...

# Commit everything
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"

# Pull latest (pyproject.toml stays yours)
git pull origin main

# Push your changes
git push origin main
```

**Weekly - sync with upstream:**
```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
# If pyproject.toml changed in upstream, you'll keep yours
git push origin main
```

That's it! No need to cherry-pick files or worry about conflicts in pyproject.toml.
