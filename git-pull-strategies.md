# Git Pull Strategies Guide

When you have divergent branches (your local branch and remote branch each have different commits), Git requires you to specify how to reconcile them. Here are the three main strategies:

## 🔀 Merge Strategy: `git pull --no-rebase`

**Configuration:** `git config pull.rebase false`

### What it does:
Creates a **merge commit** to combine the divergent branches.

```
Before:
A---B---C (your local commits)
    |
    D---E (remote commits)

After:
A---B---C---M (your local commits + merge commit)
    |      /
    D---E (remote commits merged in)
```

### ✅ Pros:
- Preserves the complete history of both branches
- Shows exactly when the merge happened
- Non-destructive - original commits remain unchanged

### ❌ Cons:
- Creates an extra merge commit
- Can make history look "messy" with lots of merge commits
- Graph can become complex with many parallel developments

### 🎯 Best for:
When you want to preserve the fact that development happened in parallel and maintain complete historical context.

## 🔄 Rebase Strategy: `git pull --rebase`

**Configuration:** `git config pull.rebase true`

### What it does:
**Replays** your local commits on top of the remote commits, as if you had made your changes after pulling.

```
Before:
A---B---C (your local commits)
    |
    D---E (remote commits)

After:
A---D---E---B'---C' (remote commits first, then your commits replayed)
```

### ✅ Pros:
- Creates a clean, linear history without merge commits
- Easier to follow project timeline
- Cleaner `git log` output

### ❌ Cons:
- Rewrites commit history (changes commit hashes)
- Can be confusing if conflicts arise during rebase
- Lost information about when branches diverged

### 🎯 Best for:
When you want a clean, linear project history and don't mind rewriting local commit history.

## ⚡ Fast-Forward Only: `git pull --ff-only`

**Configuration:** `git config pull.ff only`

### What it does:
Only allows **fast-forward** merges - fails if branches have diverged.

```
Only works when:
A---B---C (your local)
        |
        D---E (remote - extends your branch)

Results in:
A---B---C---D---E (simple fast-forward)
```

### ✅ Pros:
- Ensures you never accidentally create merge commits
- Prevents automatic rewriting of history
- Forces explicit handling of divergent branches
- Safest option for preventing unexpected changes

### ❌ Cons:
- Fails when branches have diverged (requires manual intervention)
- More steps needed when conflicts exist
- Can interrupt workflow

### 🎯 Best for:
When you want to be very careful about history and handle divergence explicitly on a case-by-case basis.

## 🛠️ Setting Global Defaults

You can set a global default strategy for all repositories:

```bash
# Set merge as default (creates merge commits)
git config --global pull.rebase false

# Set rebase as default (linear history)
git config --global pull.rebase true

# Set fast-forward only as default (explicit handling)
git config --global pull.ff only
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **For team projects:** Merge strategy preserves context about parallel work
2. **For personal projects:** Rebase strategy keeps history clean
3. **For critical projects:** Fast-forward only forces careful review of each divergence
4. **Mixed approach:** Use different strategies per situation with command-line flags

## 🔧 Handling Conflicts

- **Merge conflicts:** Resolve in files, then `git commit`
- **Rebase conflicts:** Resolve in files, then `git rebase --continue`
- **Abort if needed:** `git merge --abort` or `git rebase --abort`

---

**Remember:** Choose the strategy that best fits your project's workflow and team preferences. There's no "wrong" choice - each has its place!
